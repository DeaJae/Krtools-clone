She knew she had to survive long enough to exact revenge, and once that was done she had to ensure it never happened to another world. She accomplished the first not long after graduating from the Galactic Academy, with a legendary battle that is more often described as a massacre. Her instinct for survival and her passion for her job have led her to develop some of the best defensive tactics of any commander – ever.

However, most students put that theory in the back of their minds as they load their ships up with as much weapons and armor as they can. This often lead to chuckles from a bright young recruit named  Hellen. She was the daughter of a wealthy businessman and had learned from a young age that everything costs, and the only way to come out on top was to be more efficient than your opponent, whether in the boardroom or on the battlefield. Often wielding what seemed to be weak arsenals or deficient ship designs, she always seemed to come out on top - and much to their astonishment - usually within a few short minutes. The ability to quickly examine and determine the best use for products in business that she picked up following her father around the galaxy, provided the basis for an almost savant-like ability to select seemingly mismatched parts and equipment that perfectly complimented each other. Her ability to do so much with so little extended to the firing range as well. While most of the guys delighted in firing off as many rounds as the instructors would allow, they often failed to destroy their targets. However,  Hellen usually needed only a few shots before her target was destroyed. Always efficient, and always ruthless,  since graduating, Hellen has earned a reputation as a lethal adversary that will wait for the right moment to strike, and then with a few shots destroy her target and move on to the next victim.

Despite being under the direct command of the highest echelons of the Federation, no one knows her true identity. Rumor has it that she was once a prisoner of the Space Pirates and had decided that joining the Federation was a good way to be paid for exacting revenge.",
