# Issues
Some odd picturing issues exist due to attempting to grab imagery from wiki/fandom (terrible) and ingame.
Max Attack Calculator doesn't work right, it won't save your options.
Load/Save commanders/desgins are disabled due to issues with how localstorage works (or doesn't in this case), use 'link/share' and put url in a txt file. should load old builds if you replace url.
