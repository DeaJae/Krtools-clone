# Demonstration/ website

# Issues
- Some odd picturing issues exist due to attempting to grab imagery from wiki/fandom (terrible) and in game.
- Max Attack Calculator doesn't work right, it won't save your options.
- Load/Save commanders/designs are disabled due to issues with how local storage works (or doesn't in this case), use 'link/share' and put URL in a Txt file. should load old builds if you replace the url.
- It's not mobile friendly due to small images and numbers clumped together, not have a clue how to solve this yet.
- some undocumented features added to the live version not shown in the code for historical information.
